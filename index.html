            <h2>TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
                <p>Designed by <em>Kunio Okawara</em> and <em>Hajime Katoki</em>, Developed from <strong>XXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero</strong>, and piloted by <em>Heero Yuy</em>.</p>
                <p>The major contributor to Wing's mobility is the pair of wing units on the backpack. These units not only generate lift, but can also change the aerodynamic characteristics of the mobile suit through the movements of their individual panels, supporting a range of speeds from stall to hypersonic.</p>
            <h2>ARMAMENTS</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Buster Rifle</li>
                    <p>Wing Gundam's signature weapon, usable in MS mode and Bird Mode. </p>
                <li>Vulcan Gun</li>
                    <p>A pair of shell-firing armament built into the head. When fired in unison with the machine cannons, they will be out of bullets in less than a minute.</p>
                <li>Machine Cannon</li>
                    <p>Located on the shoulders, the two cannons are short to medium range weapons.</p>
                <li>Shield</li>
                    <p>Made of high-strength Gundanium Alloy, it can also be used as a ramming weapon.</p>
                <li>Beam Saber</li>
                    <p>The beam saber is the standard close-combat weapon for many mobile suits, it generates a blade-shaped beam to melt and cut through enemy's armor.</p>
                <li>Drei Zwerg</li>
                    <p>The Drei Zwerg is a combination of three identical component rifles known as Messer Zwerg, which can be used individually. In A.C. 195, after encountering the Proto Zero, Heero creates imperfect replicas of the Drei Zwerg for Wing Gundam.</p>
                </ul>
